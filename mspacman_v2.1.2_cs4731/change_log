Change log:

v 2.1.2

- changed the way the images and text files are loaded to allow applet version to work
- added a way to _G_ to record games for javascript replays on web-site
- localised file-name descriptors
- added the following helper methods:
	- public int getNextEdibleGhostScore();
	- public int getNumActivePills();
	- public int getNumActivePowerPills();
	- public int[] getPillIndicesActive();
	- public int[] getPowerPillIndicesActive();
- updated the sample controllers to use the new functions
- added boolean flag to GameView to prevent unnecessary storing of information
- use StringBuilder to save replays
- updated recording feature to flush string after each save
- include starter package in code distribution

known issues:

- bug in recording replays: the ghost update method (every nth game tick) causes the replay to crash whenever a power pill has been eaten). This is caused by the lack of update for edible ghosts. Fix in progress.

v 2.1.1

- changed the graphics in GameView to do double buffering
- added the ability to do simple visuals for debugging/testing/demonstrations
- changed the way a game is initialised: removed the singleton pattern
- added NearestPillPacManVS to illustrate the visuals
- added 5 (utility) methods in Game/G:
	- public int[] getPath(int from,int to);
	- public int getTarget(int from,int[] targets,boolean nearest,DM measure);
	- public int[] getGhostPath(int whichGhost,int to);
	- public int getGhostPathDistance(int whichGhost,int to);
	- public int getGhostTarget(int from,int[] targets,boolean nearest);
- changelog now included in source code distribution
